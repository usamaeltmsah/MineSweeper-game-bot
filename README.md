# MineSweeper-game-bot
This is a minesweeper game in python and AI to make it a **game bot**


To run this project you will need to run the *minesweeper file first*, which will run the game. *Then* run the *MSAI* file, which do the `bot operations`

When running the *MSAI*, make sure that *minesweeper board* is completely **visible on the screen**

This project will work good on `linux` with `python 3.5` and you need to install some libraries :

tkinter
-
random
-
collections
-
PIL
-
numpy
-
random
-
pyscreenshot
-
pyautogui
-

TODO:
-
1. We need to enhance the `tile detection`, cause it consume much time to know what is the tile content.
2. We need to make a *good algorithms* to `make the bot smarter`.
