How it works?
-
To run this project you will need to run the *minesweeper file first*, which will run the game. *Then* run the *MSAI* file, which do the `bot operations`

**`HINT:`**
When running the *MSAI*, make sure that *minesweeper board* is completely **visible on the screen**

Requiements
-
- `python 3.5`
- This project will work good on `linux` for other operating systems you may need to find similar libraries and you need to install some libraries :

tkinter
-
random
-
collections
-
PIL
-
numpy
-
pyscreenshot
-
pyautogui
-

**TODO:
-**
1. We need to enhance the `tile detection`, cause it consume much time to know what is the tile content.
2. We need to make a *good algorithms* to `make the bot smarter`.
